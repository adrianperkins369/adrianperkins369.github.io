## Executive Summary

Milia, a top-tier global delivery platform aggregator, faced growing operational and customer support challenges due to rapid product expansion. A spike in unresolved escalations, fragmented documentation, and the need for multilingual content called for an overhaul of their content strategy.

I partnered with their global support team to develop a scalable, user-focused documentation framework designed to reduce support escalations, streamline workflows, and improve both agent and customer experiences.

## Key Challenges

1. **Rising Escalation Rates**  
   Escalations from Tier 1 to Tier 2 support jumped from 10% to 25% due to outdated or difficult-to-locate SOPs.

2. **Poor First-Time Resolutions**  
   Dense and inconsistently formatted content led to repeated customer issues.

3. **Multilingual Gaps**  
   Rapid growth required localized documentation for global agents and customers, creating inconsistency and translation gaps.

4. **Asynchronous Teams**  
   Team members across different time zones struggled to align on documentation updates and priorities.

## Strategic Goals & Objectives

- Reduce escalations to <10% by refreshing critical content  
- Standardize formatting, structure, and tone across documentation  
- Implement multilingual content solutions based on regional impact  
- Improve cross-regional collaboration through documentation protocols and tools

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Content Audit & Governance

- Conducted a full audit of existing SOPs and troubleshooting documents  
- Created a content governance framework with prioritized review cycles  
- Developed standardized templates and a unified style guide

### 2. User-Focused Documentation

- Introduced clear, concise formats tailored to support agents' workflows  
- Removed redundant information and filled knowledge gaps based on agent feedback and ticket trends  
- Piloted content with select support teams before broader rollout

### 3. Scalable Translation Strategy

- Researched and selected third-party translation tools  
- Prioritized content based on market impact (e.g., Spanish, French, and Japanese regions)  
- Built a sustainable workflow for multilingual documentation updates

### 4. Global Team Enablement

- Established asynchronous communication practices (shared docs, clear handoffs)  
- Introduced collaborative tools and recurring cross-team check-ins  
- Created documentation protocols for handovers between time zones

---

## Results & Impact

- **Escalations dropped by over 50%** within one quarter of implementing the new strategy  
- **Customer satisfaction scores improved** due to faster, more consistent resolutions  
- **Documentation quality and accessibility increased**, with new content translated for the top five global regions  
- **Cross-team alignment improved**, enabling faster content updates and better global support

## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates how thoughtful content strategy, UX writing, and cross-functional collaboration can solve support challenges during periods of rapid growth. Milia now has a solid foundation for scalable, user-centered documentation that meets the needs of a global workforce and customer base.
