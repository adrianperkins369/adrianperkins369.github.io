I'm Adrian, your favorite Technical Writer! Thank you for taking the time to visit my digital portfolio. With this visualization, I hope to give you the chance to learn more about me and some of the amazing projects I've completed. I'm a seasoned Technical Writer with a strong background in QA testing, Salesforce, and DevSecOps. My passion lies in bridging the gap between complex technical concepts and user-friendly documentation.
<br>
I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation and collaboration are key, and I'm dedicated to continuous improvement in both my writing and the processes I support. Whether it's developing user manuals or documenting security protocols, I'm committed to delivering high-quality, actionable content that enhances the user experience.

<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. --->

<!--- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. --->

<!--- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->
